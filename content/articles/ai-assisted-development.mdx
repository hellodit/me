# AI-Assisted Development: Maximizing Productivity

AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT have revolutionized how we write code. Here's how to get the most out of them.

## Writing Better Prompts

The key to effective AI-assisted development is writing clear, specific prompts:

- Be explicit about the context
- Include examples of desired output
- Specify constraints and requirements

## Code Review with AI

Use AI to:

- Review code for bugs
- Suggest improvements
- Explain complex code
- Generate test cases

## Learning New Technologies

AI can help you:

- Understand documentation faster
- Get code examples
- Debug errors
- Learn best practices

## Best Practices

1. Always review AI-generated code
2. Use AI as a learning tool, not a replacement
3. Verify AI suggestions before implementing
4. Keep security in mind

## Conclusion

AI-assisted development is a powerful tool when used correctly. It can significantly boost your productivity while helping you learn and grow as a developer.
