## **Overview**

HRApps is a **multi-tenant Human Resource Management System** designed to streamline employee management, attendance tracking, and payroll automation within a single integrated platform. The project aims to simplify HR operations, reduce manual workload, and ensure process accuracy across multiple business units.
## **Scope & Features**

The system includes a wide range of modules that address critical HR functions:
- Employee & Role Management
- Payroll Automation and Overtime Calculation
- Attendance & Shift Scheduling
- Leave Request Workflow
- Document Management and Access Control
- Multi-tenant Architecture for multiple companies within one platform
- API Integrations with payment and analytics services

## **Technology Stack & Architecture**

HRApps is built using **Laravel 12**, applying **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and a **modular architecture** to ensure scalability and maintainability.

- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching and job queues
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose for containerized environments, deployed via GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Backend Design:** Service Layer and Repository Pattern for separation of business logic
- **Architecture:** Each domain (Employee, Attendance, Payroll, Document) is isolated to support independent scaling and modular enhancements

## **Role & Responsibilities**

I served as the **Technical Lead and Backend Architect**, responsible for:

- Designing the overall system architecture and database schema
- Implementing core modules such as attendance, payroll, and multi-tenancy
- Leading the backend development team and conducting code reviews
- Setting up the CI/CD deployment pipeline and API integration standards
- Ensuring code quality and best practices aligned with Laravel standards

## **Impact & Results**

The system successfully improved HR operational efficiency across multiple client organizations:
- Processed over **15,000 employee records** from various tenants
- Accelerated leave approval and payroll cycles from **3 days to less than 1 day**
- Increased system uptime and reliability through containerized deployment
